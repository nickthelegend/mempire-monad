/// one of two sources:
///
///  - **Chainlink CRE** (`onReport`): a workflow reads the roster's 24-hour
///    price moves from independent sources, reaches consensus across the DON,
///    and delivers one report through the KeystoneForwarder.
///  - **Pyth** (`postFromPyth`): anyone posts a fresh Pyth update in the same
///    transaction, and the contract derives each fighter's modifier from its
///    momentum — the spot price against Pyth's own moving average. No trusted
///    poster: the numbers come out of the price feed, inside the call.
///
/// An asset that ran fights a little stronger; one that dumped a little weaker.
///
/// The swing is capped at ±15% of stats, never touches elixir cost, and is
/// smaller than what levels give — so the market reshuffles the meta without
/// becoming a way to buy wins. Arena matches snapshot the epoch at join, so
/// both clients simulate the same numbers for the whole match.

## One paragraph

Mempire turns the market into a game. Every fighter is a real asset: BTC, MON, NVDA, BONK and 32 more. A Chainlink CRE workflow writes today's price moves on chain as small, bounded buffs and nerfs. Two players put a dollar of AUSD on a three-minute lane battle, every card they drop is a Monad transaction from a per-match session key, and the contract pays the winner in the block where both results land. A new player gets there with one passkey prompt: no seed phrase, no extension, no faucet, no popups during the match.

## Why this is a consumer payments product

Most of a consumer crypto product is the first five minutes, so that is where most of the work went:

- **Zero to account in one prompt.** Mera passkeys: the account is derived from the authenticator. It works the same on the next device, and nothing secret is ever stored.
- **Zero to funded in zero taps.** On first sign-in the relay mints the starter deck (8 ERC-721s), gets 10,000 test AUSD from Agora's faucet, and drips gas, without being asked.
- **Dollar stakes, one transaction.** AUSD is pulled with an EIP-2612 permit inside the stake transaction. The pot is quoted in dollars.
- **Payment and settlement are the same transaction.** The second seat's result claim pays 90% to the winner and 10% rake, atomically. Disagreement refunds both. Abandonment can't lock a pot.
- **No popups while playing.** A per-match session key is funded in the stake transaction. It can log plays and claim for its own seat and nothing else, and its unspent gas is swept back to the player afterwards.

## Track: recommend moving to **03 · Social, Attention & Culture**

Polaris, from the same team, is in Track 2 and is the stronger fit for Agora's T2-only cross-border bounty. Two entries from one team in one track would compete for the same three places. Mempire's real strength is cultural:
- every ticker is a fighter with a community behind it;
- the market's mood buffs and nerfs it daily;
- clans, a ladder, a live play feed and shareable cards.

Every bounty Mempire targets is open to all tracks, so moving costs nothing. T3 also opens Tencent Hunyuan (credits), which the OpenAI-compatible AI layer could add as a commentary provider. If it stays in T2, the consumer-payments framing below still holds.

| Pre-existing work | Game client, art, audio, simulation, matchmaker and clans came from the Solana version (Jul–Aug 2026). All on-chain and sponsor work is new; see README → Attribution. |
| AI tools | Claude Code wrote most of the code, tests and docs under the author's direction. Kimi is used at runtime. Higgsfield made the art earlier. |

## Bounties targeted (status: built and tested on the local fork; the keys each one still needs are in `docs/SPONSOR-GAP.md`)

| Bounty | Track | How Mempire meets the stated requirement |
|---|---|---|
| **Privy: beyond login** | All | Email sign-in creates a Privy **embedded wallet**. Its own transactions are **gas-sponsored** (`sponsor: true`). A **session signer** (`addSigners`) bound by a **policy** (default deny; only arena `play`/`checkpoint`/`claim`, value 0, this chain) sends in-match calls as the player, so there are no popups and no path to funds. 21 checks on the policy and on honest 503s without keys. **The live path needs Privy keys** (not yet provided). |
| **Monad Foundation: Mera UX** | All | Mera is the account layer, with one passkey ceremony and nothing secret stored. Signing is prompt-free. Sessions have idle and hard expiry, a visible countdown, a lock option, and step-up for big stakes. The stateless test passes. The starter deck lands about 1–3 s after sign-up. |
| **Mera: Many Keys** | All | The `mempire.locker.v1` PRF namespace feeds HKDF, which yields an AES-256-GCM key and an unlinkable storage id. That powers an end-to-end encrypted deck and notes locker that opens on any device with the passkey. |
| **Chainlink CRE** | All | A cron, HTTP-consensus, `writeReport` workflow into the `MarketMeta` receiver sets each fighter's daily ±15% modifier, which the deterministic sim applies. 33 tests, compiled to WASM. **Simulation needs `cre login`.** Meanwhile the same `MarketMeta` takes Pyth momentum, which runs live locally. |
| **Envio** | All | HyperIndex V3 with derived entities (records, net per currency, per-fighter win rates on buffed and nerfed days, the play feed, epochs with source). It runs on the local chain, and verify-local checks indexed rows against the chain (52/52). The app's **Live on Monad** panel reads it. |
| **Kimi** | All | Kimi is the AI opponent's strategist, using tool calling (`deploy_card`, `wait`, `get_market_meta`). Its moves are validated and played through the human input path, and it provides the caster lines. 46 checks against a fake Moonshot server (a test double, used only in tests). **The live path needs `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`**; without it the app offers only the classic bot, labelled as such. |
| **Monad Foundation: Community Team** | All | Only if the team was onboarded through a Metropolis community supporter. |

**Also integrated** (not a separate cash bounty):
- **Pyth:** a fresh update is pushed in the same transaction for minting and for **price-driven stats**. `MarketMeta.postFromPyth` derives modifiers from spot vs EMA on chain. Locally, an IPyth-compatible `LocalPriceOracle` accepts only relay-signed updates built from live OKX/CoinGecko quotes.
- **Agora AUSD:** the stake currency, pulled with an EIP-2612 permit.

**Not claimed:**
- Agora: a mobile trading app (T1) or cross-border remittance (T2), neither of which fits.
- Dynamic: Privy and Mera already cover the account layer.
- Kuru, Perpl, MetaMask: T1 and trading.
- Alchemy: only a URL swap here.
- Nansen: no real use for its data in a game.

## Monad integration

- Every card play is an on-chain transaction from a session key, viable only because of 300 ms blocks (final in ~600 ms) and low gas. The in-match badge shows measured send-to-receipt latency.
- The second claim settles the pot in the same block.
- Gas limits are sized from estimates (Monad bills the limit), and the session key's float is swept back after the match.
- Contracts are verified on Sourcify through MonadVision.

## Demo script (3:00)

| Time | Shot | Say |
|---|---|---|
| 0:00–0:15 | Cards screen: live prices, ▲▼ meta badges, the MarketBoard | "Every coin is a fighter, and today's market decides who's strong." |
| 0:15–0:45 | Fresh browser: **Play now → Create with passkey →** Face ID; the starter kit lands (*Your deck is on chain · 1.2s*); Empire shows 8 cards, AUSD and MON | "One passkey prompt. No seed phrase, no extension, no faucet." |
| 0:45–1:00 | Arena → **$ AUSD** → Pauper ($1) → Battle in two windows; they match | "A dollar stake, one transaction: the permit and the stake together." |
| 1:00–1:45 | The match: drop cards; the badge reads *on Monad · 7 · 0.6s*; click it to open the play on MonadVision | "Every card is a Monad transaction from a session key. 300 ms blocks make that playable." |
| 1:45–2:10 | The result: $1.80 paid, chest granted, +50 $MEMPIRE; open the chest (commit → reveal → real ERC-721s) | "The second claim settles the pot in the same block." |
| 2:10–2:30 | Card sheet: *+8% hp & dmg today*; then the CRE simulate output and the `MetaPosted` tx | "The market is the meta: Chainlink CRE writes it on chain, bounded at ±15%." |
| 2:30–2:45 | Clear site data → *I already have a Mera passkey* → same address and cards; the locker opens | "Stateless: the passkey is the account, on any device." |
| 2:45–3:00 | Live on Monad: the Envio feed, the leaderboard, win rates on buffed days | "Indexed by Envio. That's Mempire." |

## Verifiable evidence

Locally, today (reproduce with `./scripts/local-up.sh && ./scripts/test-all.sh`; details in [docs/QUALITY.md](docs/QUALITY.md)):

- **Contracts:** `forge test` 61/61, including the settlement-conservation fuzz test. Slither is triaged, with one hardening fix.
- **The whole game on a fork of Monad testnet:** `test-e2e.mjs` 25/25 covers:
  - onboarding with Agora's real faucet;
  - a BTC card minted on a live OKX quote;
  - the meta posted from momentum;
  - a $1 AUSD match staked with Agora's real permit, played, settled 90/10;
  - a chest opened and a merge;
  - a timeout refund.
- **Onboarding** 36/36, **settlement** 12/12, **persistence across a relay restart on MongoDB** 5/5, **Privy policy** 21/21, **Kimi** 46/46, **CRE** 33/33, **Envio handlers** 9/9.
- **Indexer on the fork:** `verify-local` 52/52, with every indexed row checked against the chain.
- **Simulation:** deterministic with and without the meta. The client and contract archetype derivations match for all 36 fighters.
- **Testnet:** `TODO` after the go: addresses, a settled match id, a play tx, the CRE report tx.

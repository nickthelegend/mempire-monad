/**
 * A Crown — the game's soft currency.

 * Deliberately NOT $MEMPIRE. That is a real SPL token with a real pool, and
 * a currency the game *spends* has to be stable: if the traded price ran up
 * 50x, a chest skip would cost forty dollars and nobody would spend it; if it
 * went to zero the economy would be denominated in nothing. Either way the
 * balance is set by traders rather than by the game. Crowns are earned and
 * spent in-game and never leave it. $MEMPIRE is tradable and lives on the
 * Swap screen.
 *
 *
 * This used to be the 💎 emoji, which had two problems worth fixing rather
 * than living with. It rendered as whatever diamond the player's OS shipped —
 * flat and grey on Windows, blue and glossy on Apple, a different shape on
 * Android — so the game's own currency looked like a different currency
 * depending on who was looking at it. And it was a *generic* premium currency,
 * the one every free-to-play game has, when this game has an actual token with
 * an actual mint address and an actual pool behind it.
 *
 * Drawn as an SVG so it is one shape everywhere, scales to any size without
 * going soft, and inherits the crown that the rest of the chrome already uses.
 *
 * The ids are suffixed per-instance. Two of these on one screen with the same
 * gradient id would make the second silently reuse the first's fill — which is
 * fine until one of them is `dim` and both come out bright.

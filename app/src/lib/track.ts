/**
 * Send an analytics event.
 *
 * # Why the client sends any at all
 *
 * Most of what the funnel wants to know happens *on chain*, driven from here:
 * a card is minted, a stake is escrowed. The server never sees those — they go
 * straight from the browser to Solana — so a purely server-side trail would
 * have a hole exactly where the interesting steps are. The dashboard shipped
 * with a five-step funnel of which three steps nothing emitted, which is worse
 * than four honest steps.
 *
 * # Rules it follows
 *
 * - **Never blocks.** Fire-and-forget, errors swallowed. A dropped event is a
 *   gap in a chart; a failed mint because analytics timed out is a lost player.
 * - **Never carries anything private.** The wallet address comes from the
 *   signature the API already requires; props are counts and enums only.
 * - **Batched.** Events queue for a moment and go together, so a burst of eight
 *   card mints is one request rather than eight.

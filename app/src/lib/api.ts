/**
 * Where the backend lives — resolved once, for every caller.
 *
 * The four API clients each used to default to `http://localhost:8787`. That is
 * right in development and actively wrong anywhere else: on a deployed HTTPS
 * page, `localhost` is the *visitor's* machine, so every leaderboard poll,
 * clan fetch, save and matchmaking socket opened a connection to a port on
 * their laptop. Browsers block the mixed content, the console fills with
 * failures, and the WebSocket retries forever against a host that will never
 * answer.
 *
 * So the fallback is deliberately narrow: use the configured URL; use localhost
 * only when the page is itself served from localhost; otherwise report that
 * there is no backend and let callers skip the request entirely. Every online
 * feature already degrades to local-only, so "no backend" is a supported state
 * rather than an error — this just stops the app pretending otherwise.

 * The arena.
 *
 * It used to be a green rectangle in a brown frame, which read as a spread-
 * sheet next to sixty-four pieces of hand-drawn character art. The board is
 * where a player spends three minutes staring, so it gets the same treatment
 * as everything else in this world:
 *
 * - **Gold.** The frame carries the same gold rule the panels and the column
 *   wear, with corner caps and banner posts. It is the one line that ties the
 *   board to the rest of the game.
 * - **Depth.** Stone banks, a sunken river bed, raised bridges with posts, and
 *   a soft darkening toward the outer tiles so the field is not uniformly lit.
 * - **Movement.** Two water layers scrolling at different speeds and in
 *   different directions. One scrolling texture reads as a conveyor belt.
 * - **Wear.** Faint tracks from each bridge toward the towers — the paths
 *   every unit in every match actually walks.
 *
 * Everything is memoised and disposed on unmount; this subtree rebuilds on
 * every match start.

/**
 * The wallet's $MEMPIRE, as one number the whole app reads.
 *
 * # Why this store exists
 *
 * The game used to run two currencies. Crowns were the soft one — granted
 * freely, spent on shop cards and rerolls, never leaving the game — and
 * $MEMPIRE was the hard one, spent on chest skips and clan charters. The
 * reasoning was sound in the abstract: a currency the game *spends* should not
 * be repriced by traders, so the tradable token stayed out of the checkout.
 *
 * In practice it produced a header reading `0 $MEMPIRE` beside `120 ♛`, and
 * every player read that as "I have 120 of the token this game is named
 * after". They did not. They had 120 of a thing that does not exist on chain,
 * next to none of the thing that does — and the one number they watched all
 * game was the fake one. A token economy whose visible balance is play money
 * is not a token economy, it is a scoreboard with a mint address attached.
 *
 * So there is one currency now, it is the real SPL token, and this store is
 * where its balance lives. Read it, do not cache it elsewhere: it is the only
 * copy, and it is always what the chain last said.
 *
 * # Why the balance is nullable
 *
 * `null` means "not read yet", which is not the same as zero and must not
 * render as zero — showing a real wallet 0 for the second before the first
 * read lands is exactly the throttled-RPC bug that made funded wallets look
 * empty. Callers render nothing until there is a number.

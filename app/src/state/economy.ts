/**
 * Chests — what winning pays out.
 *
 * # Crowns are gone
 *
 * This store used to hold `gems`: a soft currency granted freely, spent on
 * shop cards and rerolls, never touching the chain. The argument for it was
 * that a currency the game *spends* should not be repriced by traders. The
 * argument against it was on screen the whole time — a header reading
 * `0 $MEMPIRE` beside `120 ♛`, where the number players watched was the one
 * that did not exist. There is one currency now and it is the SPL token; see
 * `state/mempire.ts`.
 *
 * Chests therefore pay in **cards**, not currency. That is also the better
 * game: a chest you open for a fighter you can field is a reason to play the
 * next match, and a chest that pays a number is a reason to check a balance.
 *
 * The rule that survives unchanged: nothing bought here may sell stats. Power
 * comes from playing, so a paying player never out-levels a skilled one.

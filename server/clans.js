 *
 *  - **Trophies → crowns.** Mempire already earns crowns per felled tower, so a
 *    clan's standing is the sum of its members' crowns. No parallel ladder.
 *  - **Card donations → lend requests.** Clash donates fungible cards. Mempire's
 *    cards are NFTs backed by staked tokens, so they cannot be duplicated on
 *    request. A lend request is a favour: a clanmate answers it, the answer is
 *    counted, and the lender earns gems. The card itself only ever changes hands
 *    onchain — this tracks the social contract, not custody of the asset, and the
 *    UI says so.
 *
 * Members are embedded in the clan document. Fifty members is nowhere near the
 * 16MB ceiling, it makes reading a clan one query, and it makes join/leave a
 * single atomic update so the member count can never drift from the roster.

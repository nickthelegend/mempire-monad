/**
 * Copies the repo's `shared/` facts into `server/shared/`.
 *
 * The relay is built and deployed from `server/` alone — Railway's build
 * context and the Dockerfile both stop at this directory — so `../shared` does
 * not exist at runtime and a `readFileSync('../shared/roster.json')` would boot
 * fine on a laptop and crash-loop in production. The roster, the ABIs and the
 * deployment addresses are therefore vendored here, and this is the one way
 * they get refreshed: run it after a contract redeploy or a roster rebuild,
 * and commit what it writes.
 *
 *   npm run sync-shared
 *
 * It mirrors rather than merges: anything in `server/shared/` that is no longer
 * upstream is removed, so a stale deployment file cannot outlive the chain it
 * described.

 *  2. **Relay** card-play inputs between them, untouched.
 *  3. **Referee hashes.** Both clients report a state hash every 40 ticks;
 *     the first mismatched pair means the sims diverged, and both sides are
 *     told to void the match. A voided match returns stakes and rakes nothing
 *     — divergence is detected and neutralised, never silently ignored.
 *
 * The seed mixes the match id, both deck commitments and a fresh server-side
 * random word, so neither player — nor this server picking who is player 0 —

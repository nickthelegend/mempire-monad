/**
 * The relayer: the one key this server signs transactions with.
 *
 * # What it may do
 *
 * `MempireCards.mintStarter` is relayer-only, so this key is what turns a new
 * address into a player with a deck. It also pays the onboarding MON drip and
 * pokes the AUSD faucet. It is deliberately NOT the deployer or owner key —
 * that one can change the treasury, the rake and the relayer itself, and a web
 * server is the wrong place for it. Losing this key costs a refill and a
 * `setRelayer`; losing the owner key costs the game. Boot refuses a relayer
 * that is either.
 *
 * # One queue
 *
 * Every transaction this key sends goes through `sendRelayerTx`, and that
 * function runs one submission at a time. Two onboarding requests arriving
 * together would otherwise both read the same pending nonce, and the second
 * transaction would either replace the first or be rejected — a starter deck
 * that silently never lands. viem's nonce manager hands out consecutive nonces
 * and resets itself when a send fails; the queue makes sure estimate, sign and
 * send for one transaction finish before the next begins, so a failed send's
 * reset cannot race a later transaction's nonce. Receipts are awaited outside
 * the queue: waiting for inclusion is not what needs to be serial, and holding
 * the queue for it would cap the relayer at one transaction per block.
 *
 * # Gas
 *
 * Monad charges for the gas *limit*, not the gas used. A generous default limit
 * is therefore a fee, paid on every transaction, for nothing. Every send is
 * estimated and given a 15% margin — enough to absorb state moving between
 * the estimate and inclusion, and no more.
